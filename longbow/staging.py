"""A module containing methods for staging files to and from remote machines.

The staging module provides methods for processing the transfer of files
between the local host and the remote host job directories.

The following methods are contained within this module:

stage_upstream(jobs)
    A method for staging files for each job to the target HPC host. The
    underlying utility behind this transfer is rsync, thus it is possible
    to supply rsync file masks to blacklist unwanted large files. By default
    rsync is configured to transfer blockwise and only transfer the
    newest/changed blocks, this saves a lot of time during persistant staging.

stage_downstream(job)
    A method for staging files for each job to from target HPC host. The
    underlying utility behind this transfer is rsync, thus it is possible
    to supply rsync file masks to blacklist unwanted large files. By default
    rsync is configured to transfer blockwise and only transfer the
    newest/changed blocks, this saves a lot of time during persistant staging.

cleanup(jobs)
    A method for cleaning up the working directory on the HPC host, this method
    will only delete job directories that are valid for the given Longbow
    instance, thus avoid data loss.
