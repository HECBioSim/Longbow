"""A module containing methods for processing application command-lines.

The applications module contains methods for processing the aspect of jobs
which relate to external applications (such as an MD package). The following
methods can be found within this module:

testapp(jobs)
    This method will make an attempt to check that the application executables
    required to run a job/s is present on the specified host/s. This method is
    capable of using the module system.

processjobs(jobs)
    This method will process information that is given as an intended target to
    be passed on to the executable at run time. It will check that required
    parameters (provided the respective plug-in is configured correctly) have
    been supplied, and that all files and their dependencies (again provided
    that the respective plug-in is configured for this) exist on disk.
