"""A module  containing methods for dealing with configuration files.

This module contains methods for loading and saving to Longbow (ini)
configuration files in addition to methods for extracting the resultant
information into Longbow data structures. The templates for these data
structures and their forms are also declared within this module.

The following data structures can be found:

JOBTEMPLATE
    The template of the job data structure. The Longbow API will assume
    that variables listed here are to be found in this structure.

The following methods can be found:

processjobs(parameters)
    Method for processing the raw configuration structures loaded from the
    configuration files into Longbow friendly configuration structures.
    This is where the parameter hierarchy is applied.

loadconfigs(configfile)
    Method for loading and extracting data from the Longbow configuration
    files.

saveconfigs(configfile, params)
    Method for saving data to Longbow configuration files, this method will
    honour comments and simply amend the file structure with new or changed
    data.

saveini(inifile, params)
    A method to save an ini file formatted file (inifile) from a dictionary
    structure (params). This method is much simpler than the saveconfigs
    method which has been tuned to simply update configuration files.
