Writing Plugins
***************

The longbow plugins are the way we chose to incorporate software/scheduler specific features into an otherwise generically written library. The scope of this guide will cover how to create a whole new plugin within an existing category of plugins. The reason that creating new categories of plugins is not covered here is because to do so, the core of Longbow would have to be modified thus would not be update safe unless you submitted your changes to us and they get accepted into the core code. If making entirely new classes of plugins interests you, then please do get in touch so that we can sort out the details and support your plugins.

Plugins are used within Longbow to extend its functionality and support to new scheduling platforms and to support new applications. In this section of the guide we will look at how to create new plugins for both new applications and new schedulers. If you do write a plugin or many plugins, and feel others would benefit from them, get in touch, we would be happy to add them into Longbow core, it doesn't matter how messy or incomplete your code is as we will help.
