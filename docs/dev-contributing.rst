Contributing
************

Contributions to Longbow are very welcome. To prevent things from becoming unwieldy for those of us that have to support the code base long-term we ask just a few things of our contributors.

The first step in contributing is to clone the Longbow repository and then create a branch where you will work on your code/doc contribution. Please try to limit changes to one specific or set of related changes per branch, this way you can name your branch with something meaningful. If there is an existing issue in the github tracker covering your contribution, please name your branch with the issue number.

Once you have written your code change, then please modify the documentation both in the source code and in the user documentation to reflect your changes. You should also update the unit tests or add more to test your changes. We have sections of this documentation detailing how to do local docs and test builds so that you can get these working before pusing back to github.

You should make sure you add your name to the contributors section of the AUTHORS.rst file.

Then push your branch back to our repository and open a pull request for merger, your code will then be reviewed by us and if everything above checks out and your feature is in the interest of our userbase then it will be merged for the next release.

That is all there is to it. If you are unsure about your idea, then please do contact us either through the issue tracker or via email and we will be happy to discuss it with you.
