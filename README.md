Longbow is a piece of software that acts as a job proxying tool for biomolecular simulations,
Longbow reproduces the native look and feel of using popular molecular dynamics packages
(AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, LAMMPS and NAMD), with the difference that when those packages are used
through Longbow simulations can be run on High Performance Computing (HPC) resources such as 
ARCHER. Longbow handles jobs setup in terms of creating job submission scripts, automatically 
stages input files, launches and monitors jobs and stages back simulation results. The option is
also there to persistently monitor and stage (realtime local syncing with remote simulation files)
simulation files at a specified time interval.

This is designed to have the jobs running on the HPC remote resource appear to the user as if the simulation
has run on their local computer/cluster. Users do not have to concern themselves with writing submission 
files, nor do they have to worry about staging. Longbow provides a convenient interface for generating
large ensembles of simulation jobs which in effect extends the packages it supports.
