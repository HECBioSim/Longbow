This job file is a simple demonstration of how to run a single submission job.
Before attempting the following please make sure you have setup the ProxyApp
using the instructions in the main README.

To run this job simply change into the example directory and edit the job.conf
file to your information. This example is also using the default hosts.conf 
which can be found in the main ProxyApp directory, should you want to have 
yours in the same directory as the rest of the job files copy the host.conf
into your working directory and add -conf hosts.conf to the command line.
Once set up then execute the following:


proxy.py -i test.in -c test.min2 -p test.top -o test.out -jobconf job.conf


If you would like to see the logging info on screen then add the -debug flag


proxy.py -i test.in -c test.min2 -p test.top -o test.out -jobconf job.conf -debug

This should now have staged and started up your job and begun monitoring it, 
upon completion it will download all files and remove the remote files.
