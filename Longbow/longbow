    Main entry point for the Longbow application.

    To run Longbow, simply write longbow before the command you wish to
    be executed using your chosen simulation package e.g.:

    %longbow pmemd.MPI -i example.in -c example.min -p example.top -o output

    In addition, the following longbow flags may be provided before the
    executable (pmemd.MPI in the above example):

    --about
    --debug
    --disconnect
    --examples
    --help
    --hosts [file name]
    --job [file name]
    --jobname [job name]
    --log [file name]
    --recover [file name]
    --resource [remote resource name]
    --replicates [number]
    --verbose
    --version

    Read the documentation at http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow-docs for more
    information on how to setup and run jobs using Longbow.
