This module contains the Longbow application entry point and the high level
library methods. The following gives a summary of the methods available:

main(parameters)
    This method is the upper level method of the Longbow library. Users
    interested in integrating Longbow into their applications without fine
    grain control may invoke this method, along with creating the data
    structures that the main entry point of the application would normally
    create.

recover()
    This method is for attempting to recover a Longbow session. This should be
    used in cases where jobs have been submitted to the host and somehow
    Longbow failed to stay connected. This will try to take the recovery file,
    written shortly after submission to recover the whole session. Jobs that
    are no longer in the queue will be marked as finished and will be staged
    as normal.
