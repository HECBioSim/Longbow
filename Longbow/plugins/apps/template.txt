"""Some useful docstring to identify the module."""

# Important!! List the execs and its required flags in the following format.
# For scenarios where you have multiple flags that can be in an either or, but
# at least one is required (such as gromacs where you need either -s input_file
# or you can use -defnm file_name) then supply these like this
# "mdrun": ["-s || -deffnm"]
EXECDATA = {
    "pmemd": ["-c", "-i", "-p"],
    "pmemd.MPI": ["-c", "-i", "-p"]
    }

# Optional, only supply this if on your system installed applications are named
# differently than the name you gave the plugin!!! So for example amber.py will
# by default add a default module name amber. If you have a program named 
# "quazar" and it is normally loaded with 'module load somedodgymodule' then in
# your quazar.py you'd need the following:
# MODULEOVERIDE = "somedodgymodulename"
